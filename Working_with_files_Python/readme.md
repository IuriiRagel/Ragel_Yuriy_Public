The PY code 'word_count_txt.py' takes filename as input, opens the file, and displays the most often used word, and the longest English word
I ran the code on hamlet.txt, which contains EN and RU text, you can download both files, put in one folder and try it out
(just type 'hamlet.txt' when prompted)
