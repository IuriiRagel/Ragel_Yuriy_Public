<h2> Important Notes </h2>
Please note, that in order to avoid CAPTCHA during Sign In, we have implemented time.sleep() periods to simulate slow entry of username and password. This helped to avoid the CAPTCHA. When launching script from different regions, Amazon might trigger security warning for Amazon. In that case you may use any other valid Amazon accounr credentials (just update them in configs.py file)
