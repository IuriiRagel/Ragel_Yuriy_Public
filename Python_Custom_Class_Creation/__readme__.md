Several examples of custom classes creation and usage in Python

Based on PetFriends website we create new class Cat with attributes: name, sex, age (see file PetsFriends.py)
In file 'testCat.py' we import created Cat class and create two objects with data from website
Both .py files have to be in the same folder
