<h1> Several examples of custom classes creation and usage in Python </h1>

<h3> PetFriends_Website: Creating and testing Classes for Pet Friends website </h3>

In file 'testCat.py' we import created Cat class and create two objects with data from website
Both .py files have to be in the same folder
