<h1> Several examples of custom classes creation and usage in Python </h1>

<h3> Classes for Pet Friends website: 01_PetsFriends_class_Cat.py and 02_testCat.py </h3>
Based on PetFriends website we create new class Cat with attributes: name, sex, age (see file PetsFriends.py)
In file 'testCat.py' we import created Cat class and create two objects with data from website
Both .py files have to be in the same folder

<h3> Creating classes of different figures with calculate area method and then importing it into another script: 03_rectangle.py and 04_rectangle_2.py </h3>
In script 03_rectangle.py I create a new Classes for geometric shapes, and method to calculate their area.
I then import the newly created class to a new script 04_rectangle_2.py and call the calculate area method on it
